For five years Lanchonete.org (2013-18) occupies a small bar on a denigrated yet swiftly gentrifying street in the center of São Paulo as nucleus for artist and urbanist residencies, community meals, open courses, concerts, murals, public health campaigns and a radio station.

Lefebvre stepped away from The Situationists International–a group who somewhat influenced my making of freeDimensional. He coined the phrase The Right to the City (1968) with his eponymous book. I was also influenced by Benjamin and De Certeau, Umberto Eco and José Esteban Muñoz. I studied food-related works as well, e.g. FOOD by Gordon Matta-Clark, Lanchonarte by Equipe 3, Homebaked by Jeanne van Heeswijk.

The lunch counter (aka Bar do Tarcísio) lives on. Tarcísio has been its manager for forty years now. The public space and anti-stigma project now overflows to the internal roadway where trash used to fall regularly. The address is Rua Paim 235 (Loja 3); please come visit.
