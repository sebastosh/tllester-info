I/he became a sticker artist--a.k.a. el mejor karate--whilst living in São Paulo. This ad hoc process continues to clarify the pseudonym or decoy-tendency in naming my/his previous artworks.

In [Cadáver Esquisito: uma história de amor intergaláctico](/uploads/Aids_Sem_Capa_ToddLanierLester_edit.pdf "Aids_Sem_Capa_ToddLanierLester_edit.pdf"), a chapter I wrote for AIDS Sem Capa: reflexões virais sobre um mundo pós-pandemia (2022), EMK speaks up for the first time to say, “The head’s struggle with a new notion is the heart’s most soul-felt pain.”

EMK is a (sticker) graffiti persona or alter ego. Some might call him a pseudonym. We are the same and we also do things together. We did something together more recently, which was to talk about mental health for a report by On The Move entitled [Supportive Interventions for the Mental Health and Well-being of At-Risk and Displaced Arts Workers](/uploads/At-risk_Vol3_Chapter8.pdf "At-risk_Vol3_Chapter8.pdf"). What a mouthful? Sometimes he signs; sometimes I sign.
