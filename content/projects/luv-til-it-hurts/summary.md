  In the making of LUV I already knew it would be the last of a three-part
  series of works. It would last only two years, at first.  After that it became Exquisite Corpse, a traveling group show and soapbox (including the LUV game) that can be homemade and occur wherever needed. LUV broke the silence for a 2023 [op-ed in The Tennessean](https://www.tennessean.com/story/opinion/contributors/2023/03/31/culture-war-threatens-health-lives-people-with-hiv-in-tennessee/70069750007/) pertaining to the accessibility of HIV meds in my home state and just before that in the 2022 book, [AIDS Sem
  Capa](https://tllester.info/Aids_Sem_Capa_ToddLanierLester_edit.pdf) on
  HIV/AIDS-related art. The latter may serve as a flexible curatorial statement for the Exquisite Corpse show. 

  Two examples are the Colombian artist Daniel Santiago Salguero bringing the
  process to Bogotá via his work, [Luciérnagas](https://inesmagazina.com/magazina/saniel_santiago_salguero_in-first-person/). Another is how LUV was integrated into [On Illness, Resistance and Modes of Collective (Health) Care](https://district-berlin.com/en/on-illness-resistance-and-modes-of-collective-health-care-3/) at District (Berlin).
