  The last time I put on my fD hat was for a report on the Mental Health and Well-being of At-Risk and Displaced Arts Workers. Before that I helped with Artist Safety Hosting: A Guide to History, Ethics, & Practice. I also co-wrote Artists' Safety and Creative Safe Havens and Art Spaces Hosting Activism. fD
  lasted ten years and then changed names to Artist Safety Net in order to consult on larger safety projects and co-found the Arts Rights Justice Academy (Univ of Hildesheim) and the New York City Artist Safe Haven Prototype (Westbeth).
