*FARM/SCHOOL plays with time differently than the previous series, suggesting its arrival–rather than completion–in about 10 years.*

FARM/SCHOOL is a nascent project in rural Middle Tennessee I’m making with my family. It is currently designated by ‘f/s’. f/s is a concept that encompasses the process of homecoming/going as well as a business plan for a farm development that includes artists in decision-making roles. The end results are varied I suggest and may include a misspelled tattoo on my left upper leg (see #19), a site-specific architectural work by Jakub Szczęsny for artist dwelling and production, an adjacent intentional community of supporters, and an ongoing infrastructure that will maintain a fully-blossomed artist residency called FARM/SCHOOL with a broad community outlook. I say in #19 that I’m not sure how (or if) el mejor karate might interpolate with FARM/SCHOOL (f/s). I am sure however that I’ll write an account of the process by which I get to know my family again after years of being away from Tennessee, and the farm. The farm was my school. My parents ultimately spymasters who sent me out on my first missions. My doctor recently remarked that I ‘suffer’ to keep my word in relation to being on the Bipolar Continuum. While this may be agglomerated into a condition, I argue that it is a farmerly trait I learned from my dad. Both my parents are principal actors in this work.

Looking forward, I can most accurately show you some of my methodology-in-action. This is not so much a timed project as it is a slow one. Please follow along.
