 While freeDimensional was a 10 year project that engaged residencies around the world in the service of artist mobility and safety, the Lanchonete(.)org investigation--and five-year project--was site-specific; asking if a specific bar, apartment compound, street and neighborhood might interact with (and even change because of) guest artists and urbanists focused on common issues in the city. While a Sarai Reader photo essay, BOMB interview and the Anatomy of a Durational Project (ch) were made when the project started as a concept, São Paulo, a mosaic as viewed from Paim Street was written together with a collective member during the occupation of the street that now continues with new artists as Arraiá da Paim. In a new PhD research on our work, the author includes Lanchonete(.)org among the city's [emergent cultural structures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Py0FLsJ0NKY).
